# Exploring Surface Processes using CSDMS Modeling Tools: How to Build Coupled Models

*A hands-on short course on model coupling at the 2020 GSA Annual Meeting*


## Abstract

Predicting long-term Earth surface change or the impacts of short-term
natural hazards requires computational models. Many existing numerical
models quantitatively describe sediment transport processes,
predicting terrestrial and coastal change at a great variety of
scales. However, these models often address a single process or
component of the earth surface system. The Community Surface Dynamics
Modeling System (CSDMS) is an NSF-funded initiative that supports the
open software efforts of the surface processes community. CSDMS
distributes >300 models and tools, and provides cyberinfrastructure to
simulate lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, or cryosphere
dynamics. Many of the most exciting problems in these fields arise at
the interfaces of different environments and through complex
interactions of processes. This workshop presents recent
cyberinfrastructure tools for hypothesis-driven modeling: the Python
Modeling Tool (PyMT) and Landlab. PyMT allows users to interactively
run and couple numerical models contributed by the community, and
Landlab is a library for building 2D numerical models. The full-day
tutorial aims to provide a short overview of the PyMT and Landlab, a
demonstration of running a coupled model, and hands-on exercises using
Jupyter Notebooks in small groups of attendees.
